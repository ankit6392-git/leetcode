🚀 DSA Problems Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
I am maintaining this repo to track my learning, improve problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

🛠 Topics Covered

✔️ Arrays & Strings
✔️ Linked List (SLL, DLL, Circular)
✔️ Stacks & Queues
✔️ Recursion & Backtracking
✔️ Trees & Binary Search Trees
✔️ Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, MST)
✔️ Dynamic Programming
✔️ Greedy Algorithms
✔️ Hashing & Maps
✔️ Sorting & Searching

🎯 Goals

✅ Solve at least 1 problems daily

✅ Cover all major DSA topics step by step

✅ Write clean, optimized, and well-documented code
